In this repository, I conducted different machine learning techniques on four different datasets. 

# Classifiers
I evaluated the choices for classification of data from a brain region that activated when participants saw line drawings. I tried using different classifiers and assessed the optimal option. 

# Permutation Analysis
I performed a group-level permutation analysis across subjects for line drawings that activated different regions of the brain. 

# Clustering and LDA
I first performed k-means clustering on different news groups' data, and then conducted a linear discriminant analysis to identify meaningful topic structures within the data. 

# Neural Network Classifier
I designed a shallow neural network classifier to try and classify a set of images of handwritten digits. I then applied data augmentation, designed a deep network and tried classifying the digits again.
